Welcome to my personal **HTML & CSS Learning Journey** repository!  
Here, I document my hands-on progress as I explore the world of full stack web development—from the basics of HTML structure to CSS styling techniques.

## 📚 What This Repo Is About

This project is my self-paced and practice-oriented notebook to:

- Write real, working HTML and CSS
- Build web page structures from scratch
- Experiment with visual layouts and design concepts
- Apply what I learn in tutorials, articles, and courses
- Track my growth as a web developer

Each file or folder represents a lesson, concept, or project I've worked on.
